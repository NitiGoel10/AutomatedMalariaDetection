# AutomatedMalariaDetection
The project actively aims at building a convolutional neural network to quickly predict the presence of malaria parasitized cells in a thin blood smear and distinguish the infected cell images from the uninfected ones.
The primary & major motivation of this project is to help malaria detection and reduce manual labour with a low-cost, effective, and accurate open source deep learning solution as early detection can save lives.

The dataset is taken from the official website of Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria


The dataset contains 2 folders -
Infected and
Uninfected cell images.
And a total of 27,558 images.
